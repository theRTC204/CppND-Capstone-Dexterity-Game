# CPPND: Capstone Dexterity Game

This repo serves as my Capstone project for the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The inspiration for this project was a puzzle game by the same name, developed by SNK Corporation, originally released in 1990 for the Nintendo Game Boy.

Some aspects of the code were adapted from [this sample project](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Capstone-Snake-Game) provided by Udacity. My reference for building a game using SDL came from [these excellent tutorials](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/) provided by Lazy Foo' Productions.
